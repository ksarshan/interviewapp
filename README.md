# InterviewAPP

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/ksarshan/interviewapp.git
$ cd employee
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ virtualenv2 --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal

The final step is to enter your password. You will be asked to enter your password twice, the second time as a confirmation of the first.
